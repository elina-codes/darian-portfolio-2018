          h3 Overview
          p
            | This was a platform built 
            strong for people to selflessly help each other
            | . It was designed to make it fun and easy for friends and neighbors to give and get help for anything, anywhere.
          h3 The problem
          p
            | When I came on board, the devs had already built an MVP but were 
            strong
              | not seeing any traction
              | at all. There was no clear vision from the CEO
            | , and every dev in the company had
            |                         an equal say in how the site should be designed and built. This resulted in a Frankenstein&rsquo;s
            |                         monster of an MVP, with 
            strong
              | no flow, no informational hierarchy or prioritization, and an
              | overwhelming amount of poorly thought-out features
            |  that meant nothing to their
            |                         users.
          h3 My role
          p
            | I was hired on as the Lead UX Designer, 
            strong
              | to redo the MVP and to get this product back on
              | track.

            |  It was designed and built
            |                         by the programmers, and seemed to have no consistency, focus, or flow. They knew it needed some
            |                         work, but did not understand how much, so 
            strong
              | I started doing quick Usability Tests to show
              | them the overwhelming, negative feedback
            | , and that almost everything needed to
            |                         change.

              | goals.
            |  This presented an even greater challenge because he had not really defined
            |                         them before, and he wanted to target two completely opposite audiences with the same features.
          p
            | I worked with him and the team to come up with some targets to hit and some KPIs to start
            | tracking.

        An unused clock can actually turn into something meaningful! Due to the innards of the clock is made up of different mechanical parts, itâ€™s not possible to just simply recycle it. The frame of a clock is just like a picture frame, so I have decided to take out all the innards of the clock and can turn it to an actual picture frame.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
		<strong>Supplies:</strong><br />
		Clock (preferably with glass cover)<br>
		Pair of scissors<br>
		 Ascrewdriver or similar tool<br>
		  Small piece of poster paper<br>
		  Glue or tape<br>
A picture  <br />
		  <br />
		  <br />
	      <strong>Procedure:</strong><br />
1. Remove all mechanical parts of the clock from the back.  <br>
		  2. Remove the back layer of the clock.<br>
		  3. Place the poster paper over the back layer of clock and trace the edges.<br>
		  4. Use scissors to cut out the edges.<br>
		  5. Glue the poster paper to the back layer of clock.<br>
		  6. Organize the way you want to position the photos<br>
		  7. Tape the photos onto the poster paper.<br>
		  8. Place the back layer back into the clock frame.<br>
	    9. Recycle all unused parts and leftover poster paper.<br />

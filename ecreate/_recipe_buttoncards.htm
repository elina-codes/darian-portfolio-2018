        I have gathered different excess buttons I have from old sweaters or extra buttons from purchasing sweaters over the years, and have realized it would like flowers by simply adding some green stitching with it. It is very simple and easy to make, and would look really pretty just with plain white cardboard.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
		<strong>Supplies:</strong><br />
		  Plain white cardboard<br />
		  Glue<br />
		  Scissors<br />
		  Green threads<br />
		  Any kind of buttons<br />
          <br />
	 	  <br />
    	<strong>Procedure:</strong><br />
		  1.        Have the cardboard cut into desire card size<br />
		  2.        Fold the piece of cardboard in half<br />
		  3.        Carefully apply thin strips of glue on the card to stick dash lines of stitching on the card<br />
		  4.        Apply glue on the back of the buttons<br />
	    5.        Stick button down to desire position on the card aligning the green stitching<br />

		  Create a wrap from a button-down shirt. The trick to this easy DIY project is choosing the right shirt. For a grungy look, go with something casual. For an upscale wrap, choose a blouse with a classy design, or made of fine materials like satin.<br />
	      <br />
	      <br />
	      <strong>Supplies:</strong><br />
	      A button-down shirt, either long or short sleeved <br>
	      Scissors <br>
	      Measuring tape <br>
	      Chalk <br />
		  <br />
		  <br />
		  <strong>Procedure:</strong><br />
		  1. Put on the shirt and mark two inches below your bust with the chalk. Take off the shirt and repeat this mark across the shirt so that you have a nice line to cut. <br>
		  2. Lay your shirt out on the floor. Cut the shirt across your chalk line. Make sure you are cutting through the front and back of the shirt. <br>
		  This is great for a grunge look, but if you want a more polished look, you can hem the edge. <br>
		  3. You don't have to hem your wrap, but if you are going for a more polished look, this will make the wrap look finished. <br>
		  4. Turn up the bottom of the wrap about a 1/2&quot; and pin it in place. Iron the hem to make a nice crease. Sew it a 1/8&quot; from the edge. <br>
		  5.	T his wrap looks fantastic with a simple flowing skirt that you can make yourself.<br />

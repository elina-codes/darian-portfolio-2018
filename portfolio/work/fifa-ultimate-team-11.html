            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              This is the first FIFA Ultimate Team DLC package that I worked on at
              <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-ca" target="blank">Electronic Arts Canada</a>
              as a UX and Game Designer, though the game was originally launched in 2009.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the game mode was picking up a lot of good momentum, my main task was to design the supporting Web App for the game, as well as some
              minor in-game features like the leaderboards system.
            </p>
            <p>Below are my examples from this project.</p>

            <h3>The Web App</h3>
            <p>
              By FIFA Ultimate Team 11, it was in its third year of production, but this was the first year it was getting a supporting web app.
            </p>

            <p>
              My tasks were to transfer the selected features and functionality from the console version over to the web app. I would create the
              functionality with wireframes, then work closely with the IDs to create the mockups.
            </p>

            <p>Here you can see a wireframe next to the final outcome.</p>

            <h3>Leaderboards</h3>
            <p>
              On the console side, the leaderboards were a pretty simple task and a good introduction to the world of FIFA Ultimate Team. I created
              the functionality, flow and wireframes for the screens, then worked with an UI Designer to produce the final mockups.
            </p>
            <p>
              Though I've lost the wireframes, here you can see the final mockup of the leaderboards feature.

          <div class="grid__item grid__image">
            <p>
              When we released the web app, the amount of trading increased by 8x, almost overnight, and purchases with in-game currency almost went
              up by a factor of 3 when measuring web app users vs console-only users.
            </p>
            <p>
              Though I don't quite remember the outcome of the leaderboards, it's interesting to note that the leaderboards are still in FIFA Ultimate
              Team 17, with nearly identical functionality, just styled differently.

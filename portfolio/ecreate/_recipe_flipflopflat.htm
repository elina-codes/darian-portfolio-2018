		  Flip flops would usually wear out in one summer, but the base of the unwanted flip flop can actually be turned into the base of a pair of flats of flippers to be worn at home. They are easy to make and would last for another period of time.<br />
	      <br />
	      <br />
	      <strong>Supplies:</strong><br />
	      A cotton or nylon piece of clothe<br>
	      Thicker thread for stitching or glue or one ended pin<br>
	      Unwanted flip flop<br />
		  <br />
		  <br />
		  <strong>Procedure:</strong><br />
		  1.        Break off top support of unwanted flip flop<br>
		  2.        Clean base of flip flop<br>
		  3.        Cut the clothe into suitable top and side support for slipper or flat<br>
		  4.        Sometimes the base can be too hard or thick to stitch, so maybe using glue will be ideal in some cases<br>
		  5.        Attach all parts together and make sure parts are firmly attached<br>
		  6.        Enjoy your new flat and slipper!<br />

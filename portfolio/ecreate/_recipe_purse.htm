		  There are so many cute cloth placemats at the thrift store that don't quite complete a full set. Put these to good use. Making a purse out of a placemat takes just a few minutes.<br />
	      <br />
	      <br />
	      <strong>Supplies:</strong><br />
A decorative cloth placemat<br>
A pair of purse handles (found at any craft store or Wal Mart)<br>
Sewing kit or sewing machine<br />
		  <br />
		  <br />
		  <strong>Procedure:</strong><br />
		  1.	Fold the placement in half- Lay the placemat face up on the floor. Fold up the bottom of the placemat.<br>
		  2.	Sew up about 1/8‚Äù from the edge for both sides of the folded placemat<br>
		  3.	Center a handle on one side, just below the top. To find the center, gently fold one side in half. Be sure that your metal handle fasteners do not show. Sew around the metal hoops of the handle fastener. Use a buttonhole stitch for the best results. When you sew the handles on, be sure you are using a thread that matches the outside of the placemat. If your placemat is lined, sew only through the inner layer so that no stitching shows on the outside of the bag. <br>
		  4.	A pretty purse finished in just minutes! <br />

                        <p>Developed at <a href="http://athinkingape.com/" target="blanl">A Thinking Ape</a>, Perfect
                            Drift was an Android game where you had to win street races to gain and maintain turf
                            dominance.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>The problem</h3>
                    <p>This game was extremely far behind schedule as it had switched Lead Designers three times. A lot
                        of money was being sunk into this, and designs kept getting reworked, with no end in sight.</p>

                    <h3>My role</h3>
                    <p>Assisting the founders, who were now the Lead Designers, I helped get their project back on
                        track with my Team Management and UX skills. I helped them prototype new mechanics,
                        communicated their designs to the team, and made sure everyone had what they needed to continue
                        their tasks.</p>

                    <h3>Paper Prototyping</h3>
                    <p>When I joined this project, the game was well into production, however the Lead Designer wanted
                        to redesign the core mechanics (again). Since I have a lot of experience with prototyping, we
                        locked ourselves in a room for a week and, under my lead, prototyped some games on paper.</p>
                    <p>Here you can see a few images of some of the paper prototypes for the boost mechanic, as well as
                        a video of us trying it out.</p>

                    <h3>Hi-Fi Prototypes</h3>
                    <p>After ironing out the details on the mechanics, we created a high-fidelity prototype. We then
                        went through several iterations of the mechanics and prototyping phases until we got
                        consistent, positive feedback.</p>

                    <p>Once the core mechanics were finally done and back on track, I helped out by balancing some
                        sections in the game.</p>

                    <p><strong>Here you can view a few spreadsheets</strong> that contain some of the stat balancing I

                    <h3>Reiterative Design</h3>
                    <p>Throughout the entire production cycle of Perfect Drift, the vision changed so frequently that
                        there was a lot of reiteration for all of the screens, and I was constantly in charge of
                        communicating the changes to the UI Designers.</p>

                    <p>To show you the amount of work we all did due to the constant iterations, here you can see an

                    <p>In terms of this game hitting its targets for the company, this game was the most epic of fails.
                        Really. But I learned a lot about what not to do with a product.</p>
                    <p>The main thing was that you can't spend all of your time constantly reiterating designs based on
                        opinion for a full year until it's ready to go live. You need constant testing, every step of
                        the way with your target audience. Not only could that have saved this game from being a
                        disaster, but it could have kept the team morale up, as they would be getting feedback on their
                        hard work much earlier on.</p>
                    <p>There were so many other lessons too, but you probalby don't want to spend an hour reading about
                        them now.</p>

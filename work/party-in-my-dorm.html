                    <h4>UX Security Design</h4>
                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <p>Our users often fell victim to account fraud or hacking.</p>

                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <p>I redesigned the registration system to limit the number of devices our users could use for one
                        account. This required a new system of screens and edge cases for the user to link their
                        account with our custom registration service, as well as through facebook, with rewards at
                        every step of the way to encourage them to fully protect their account.</p>
                    <p>Here you can see the <a href="../images/party-in-my-dorm-05.jpg" target="blank">flow chart</a>
                        and <a href="../images/party-in-my-dorm-06.jpg" target="blank">wireframes</a> for the
                        registration system.</p>

                    <h3>Result</h3>
                    <p>This resulted in an almost 50% drop of account related tickets being submitted to our Customer
                        Service team.

                    <h4>New Content</h4>
                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <p>When I took over as product lead, I noticed that the feedback and metrics from our hardcore
                        players suggested they wanted some new challenges, and were getting bored with our game. To
                        make things worse, at the time we did not have the resources available to create entirely new
                        features.</p>

                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <p>I introduced an entirely new difficulty level to the game with much bigger rewards. This was
                        achieved by taking the existing content, duplicating it in our CMS, outsourcing some art work,
                        and rebalancing the game stats in the backend.</p>

                    <p>Here you can see a few images of some different dorm rooms. They goal was to play the game until
                        you collected all of the objects in these rooms. Each object would also boost your stats.</p>

                    <h3>Result</h3>
                    <p>The result was a huge! There was a steady increase in revenue, late game retention, and a lot of
                        satisfied players. Best of all, it required no dev work to accomplish.</p>

                    <h3>Promotions</h3>
                    <p>I would also organize events and promotions to keep our users engaged and happy.

                        <p>I worked closely with the art department and copywriter to come up with fun rewards and
                            events, sometimes working with outsourced art contractors, and would balance the rewards
                            and stats before releasing it live.

                            <p>Here you can see some of the Christmas Pugs (my favourites) that our users had to
                                collect over the holiday season. This was the most popular challenge we had to date and
                                resulted in doubling our revenue during the holiday season. People love pugs!</p>

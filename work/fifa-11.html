                        <p>Joining near the end of production, and right before release, my tasks were repetitive but,
                            coming from the Wii, a great intro into next gen development.</p>

                    <h3>My Role</h3>
                    <p> I helped out on the design and production team by writing new stories for career mode, setting
                        up tournaments, and answering questions from the translation team in Spain.</p>

                    <h3>Career Mode and Tournaments</h3>
                    <p>One of my tasks was to write news stories for Career Mode, which were then translated into 16
                        different languages. This also made me the liaison with the Localization department in Spain.</p>

                    <p>I was also tasked with setting up some tournaments, which required a lot of research on football
                        tournaments from around the world.</p>

                    <p>Here you can see a screenshot from Career Mode where you can see my tiny, tiny bit of story at
                        the bottom-middle.</p>

                    <p>Though it was more filler tasks and not so much UX Design work, it was still a good experience.
                        It landed me a spot on FIFA Ultimate Team where I really got to start diving deeper into UX
                        Design for games.</p>

                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>This is the first FIFA Ultimate Team DLC package that I worked on at <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-ca"
                            target="blank">Electronic Arts Canada</a> as a UX and Game Designer, though the game was
                        originally launched in 2009.</p>
                    <p>As the game mode was picking up a lot of good momentum, my main task was to design the
                        supporting Web App for the game, as well as some minor in-game features like the leaderboards
                        system.</p>
                    <p>Below are my examples from this project.</p>

                    <h3>The Web App</h3>
                    <p>By FIFA Ultimate Team 11, it was in its third year of production, but this was the first year it
                        was getting a supporting web app.</p>

                    <p>My tasks were to transfer the selected features and functionality from the console version over
                        to the web app. I would create the functionality with wireframes, then work closely with the
                        IDs to create the mockups.</p>

                    <p>Here you can see a wireframe next to the final outcome.</p>

                    <h3>Leaderboards</h3>
                    <p>On the console side, the leaderboards were a pretty simple task and a good introduction to the
                        world of FIFA Ultimate Team. I created the functionality, flow and wireframes for the screens,
                        then worked with an UI Designer to produce the final mockups.</p>
                    <p>Though I've lost the wireframes, here you can see the final mockup of the leaderboards feature.</p>

                <div class="grid__item work__image">
                    <p>When we released the web app, the amount of trading increased by 8x, almost overnight, and
                        purchases with in-game currency almost went up by a factor of 3 when measuring web app users vs
                        console-only users.</p>
                    <p>Though I don't quite remember the outcome of the leaderboards, it's interesting to note that the
                        leaderboards are still in FIFA Ultimate Team 17, with nearly identical functionality, just
                        styled differently.</p>

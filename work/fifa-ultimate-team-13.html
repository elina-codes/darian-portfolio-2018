                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>This is the third FIFA Ultimate Team DLC package that I worked on at <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-ca"
                            target="blank">Electronic Arts Canada</a> as a UX and Game Designer.</p>
                    <p>This year, I created an extremely powerful new introduction flow for our users, which resulted
                        in a +45% increase in day 1 retention and +30% in day 2 retention. This is also the year where
                        we tripled revenue.</p>
                    <p>Below are some examples of my work on this project.</p>

                    <h3>Lots of prototyping!</h3>
                    <p>After looking at the metrics from last year's game, it seemed that there was a huge dropoff of
                        users on day 1. Since the game had solid mechanics and was generating good revenue, we had to
                        tackle the issue of this dropoff. I was put in charge of creating a brand new onboarding
                        experience for our users.</p>

                    <p>I ran extensive usability tests on this feature throughout the whole pre-production and
                        production phases of this project, which went through several iterations.

                        <p>Here you can watch a fan made video of their first introduction to FIFA Ultimate Team, using
                            the onboarding flow I designed. You can also view the <a href="../images/fifa-ultimate-team-13-03.jpg"

                    <h3>Smaller Tasks</h3>
                    <p>The introduction flow was the majority of my time, but I still worked on several other screens
                        in the game to improve their functionality. This Team of the Week Challenge feature was new to
                        the game this year and required work from the ground up. </p>

                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>This is <strong>the first FIFA Ultimate Team DLC package that I worked on at <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-ca"
                            target="blank">Electronic Arts Canada</a> as a UX and Game Designer</strong>, though the game was originally launched in 2009.</p>
                    <p>As the game mode was picking up a lot of good momentum, <strong>my main task was to design the
                        supporting Web App for the game</strong>, as well as some minor in-game features like the leaderboards
                        system.</p>
                    <p>Below are my examples from this project.</p>

                    <h3>The Web App</h3>
                    <p>By FIFA Ultimate Team 11, it was in its third year of production, but this was the first year it
                        was getting a supporting web app.</p>

                    <p><strong>My tasks were to transfer the selected features and functionality from the console version over
                        to the web app</strong>. I would create the functionality with wireframes, then work closely with the
                        IDs to create the mockups.</p>

                    <p><strong>Here you can see a wireframe next to the final outcome.</strong></p>

                    <h3>Leaderboards</h3>
                    <p>On the console side, the leaderboards were a pretty simple task and a good introduction to the
                        world of FIFA Ultimate Team. <strong>I created the functionality, flow and wireframes for the screens,
                        then worked with an UI Designer to produce the final mockups.</strong></p>

                    <p>When we released the web app, <strong>the amount of trading increased by 8x, almost overnight, and

                        console-only users.</p>
                    <p>Though I don't quite remember the outcome of the leaderboards, <strong>it's also interesting to note that the
                        leaderboards are still in FIFA Ultimate Team 17, with nearly identical functionality,</strong> just
                        styled differently.</p>

                    <p><strong>This year, my jobs were to redesign the New Items flow to be more intuitive, increase fun and
                        engagement wherever possible, and incorporate best UX practices on all new designs.</strong></p>
                    <p>Below are some examples of my work on this project.</p>

                    <h3>Prototyping and Testing</h3>
                    <p>From the user information gathered from the marketing and data teams, <strong>I came up with an initial
                        design for the New Items flow. I then gathered feedback from our usability tests</strong> with the
                        wireframes, then worked with the Interface Designers to create proper mockups.</p>

                    <p><strong>Here you can see an image of the original paper prototype and a video from one of our final
                        paper prototype sessions.</strong> In this video, you can see how I conduct my sessions; giving them a
                        task scenario, and then unbiasedly prompting them to speak their mind to ensure I get the best
                        and most accurate feedback from them.</p>

                    <p>The updated New Items flow resulted in overall <strong>less time spent on this screen. Though that may
                        sound like a bad thing, it was actually good. It meant our players could manage their new items
                        much faster and get back to playing the game or buying more packs of cards.</strong> This was also a
                        huge win for prototyping at the company, as it got a lot of attention from upper management and
                        other product managers at the company.</p>

                    <p><strong>From last year's game, we noticed that there was a 40% dropoff after the very first screen, so this year, I created an extremely powerful new introduction flow for our users to address that.</strong></p>

                    <p>Since the game had solid mechanics and was generating good revenue, we had to
                        tackle the issue of this dropoff.</p>

                    <p><strong>I ran extensive usability tests on this new introduction flow</strong> throughout the whole pre-production and production phases of this project, which went through several iterations.</p>

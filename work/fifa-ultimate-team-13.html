                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>This is the first FIFA Ultimate Team DLC package that I worked on at <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-ca"
                            target="blank">Electronic Arts Canada</a> as a UX and Game Designer, though the game was
                        originally launched in 2009.</p>
                    <p>As the game mode was picking up a lot of good momentum, my main task was to design the
                        supporting Web App for the game, as well as some minor in-game features like the leaderboards
                        system.</p>
                    <p>Below are my examples from this project.</p>

                    <h3>The Web App</h3>
                    <p>By FIFA Ultimate Team 11, it was in its third year of production, but this was the first year it
                        was getting a supporting web app.</p>

                    <p>My tasks were to transfer the selected features and functionality from the console version over
                        to the web app. I would create the functionality with wireframes, then work closely with the
                        IDs to create the mockups.</p>

                    <p>Here you can see a wireframe next to the final outcome.</p>

                    <h3>Leaderboards</h3>
                    <p>On the console side, the leaderboards were a pretty simple task and a good introduction to the
                        world of FIFA Ultimate Team. I created the functionality, flow and wireframes for the screens,
                        then worked with an UI Designer to produce the final mockups.</p>

                    <p>When we released the web app, the amount of trading increased by 8x, almost overnight, and

                        console-only users.</p>
                    <p>Though I don't quite remember the outcome of the leaderboards, it's interesting to note that the
                        leaderboards are still in FIFA Ultimate Team 17, with nearly identical functionality, just
                        styled differently.</p>

                    <p>This year, my jobs were to redesign the New Items flow to be more intuitive, increase fun and
                        engagement wherever possible, and incorporate best UX practices on all new designs.</p>
                    <p>Below are some examples of my work on this project.</p>

                    <h3>Prototyping and Testing</h3>
                    <p>From the user information gathered from the marketing and data teams, I came up with an initial
                        design for the New Items flow. I then gathered feedback from our usability tests with the
                        wireframes, then worked with the Interface Designers to create proper mockups.</p>

                    <p>Here you can see an image of the original paper prototype and a video from one of our final
                        paper prototype sessions. In this video, you can see how I conduct my sessions; giving them a
                        task scenario, and then unbiasedly prompting them to speak their mind to ensure I get the best
                        and most accurate feedback from them.</p>

                    <p>The updated New Items flow resulted in overall less time spent on this screen. Though that may
                        sound like a bad thing, it was actually good. It meant our players could manage their new items
                        much faster and get back to playing the game or buying more packs of cards. This was also a
                        huge win for prototyping at the company, as it got a lot of attention from upper management and
                        other product managers at the company.</p>

                    <p>This year, I created an extremely powerful new introduction flow for our users, which resulted
                        in a +45% increase in day 1 retention and +30% in day 2 retention. This is also the year where
                        we tripled revenue.</p>

                    <h3>Lots of prototyping!</h3>
                    <p>After looking at the metrics from last year's game, it seemed that there was a huge dropoff of
                        users on day 1. Since the game had solid mechanics and was generating good revenue, we had to
                        tackle the issue of this dropoff. I was put in charge of creating a brand new onboarding
                        experience for our users.</p>

                    <p>I ran extensive usability tests on this feature throughout the whole pre-production and
                        production phases of this project, which went through several iterations.

                        in the game to improve their functionality. This Team of the Week Challenge feature was new to

                        <p>This was a chat application that I designed as an experiment to learn more about spending behaviour in mobile games.</p>

                    <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
                    
                    <p>My hypothesis was that people will spend money to increase their status in games, and will spend a ridiculous amount in order to guard and keep that status.</p>
                    
                    <p>I needed to control the environment as much as possible, so I needed to answer "what is the least amount of 'game' that I can make, that encourages people to spend money for their status?".</p>

                    <h3>The "Game"</h3>
                    <p>It's a simple chat application, but every time you send a message, it displays your name, your location, and your level. If you want to increase your level, you must pay a dollar.</p>

                    <p>Messages are posted in white text into the chat, but the top 1% of the users who have the highest level will have their message displayed in blue text. That's it. If someone bumps you out of the 1% by having a higher level than you, you lose the blue text on your messages. So the idea is that people that get bumped out will then spend more to get back into the 1%.</p>

                    <p>Here you can see some of the wireframes I made and communicated to the UI Designer, who made the final mockups. It is a small app and there are only about 5 screens and a few edge cases I had to consider.</p></p>

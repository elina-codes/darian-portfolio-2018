                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>
                            This was a chat application that I
                            <strong>designed as an experiment to learn more about spending behaviour</strong>
                            in mobile games.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
                        <p>
                            My hypothesis was that
                            <strong>
                                people will spend money to increase their status in games, and will spend a ridiculous
                                amount in order to guard and keep that status.
                            </strong>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I needed to control the environment as much as possible, so I needed to answer "what is the
                            least amount of 'game' that I can make, that encourages people to spend money for their
                            status?".
                        </p>

                        <h3>The "Game"</h3>
                        <p>
                            It's a simple chat application, but
                            <strong>
                                every time you send a message, it displays your name, your location, and your level. If
                                you want to increase your level, you must pay a dollar
                            </strong>
                            .
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Messages are posted in white text into the chat, but
                            <strong>
                                the top 1% of the users who have the highest level will have their message displayed in
                                blue text
                            </strong>
                            . That's it. If someone bumps you out of the 1% by having a higher level than you, you lose
                            the blue text on your messages.
                            <strong>
                                So the idea is that people that get bumped out of the 1% will then spend more to get
                                back into the 1%.
                            </strong>

                            As this was a project I came up with, I knew I would need some help as I'm not great at UI
                            Design, and know nothing about implementation.
                        </p>

                                Here you can see some of the wireframes I made and communicated to the UI Designer, who
                                made the final mockups
                            </strong>
                            . It is a small app and there are only about 5 screens and a few edge cases I had to
                            consider.

                            I ended up finding someone to build this with me, and

                                while the backend was being worked on, I busied myself with everything else in the
                                process of releasing it to the world.

                        <p>
                            I taught myself how to build the front end, I researched the submission process, how
                            microtransactions work, legal stuff, and the website.

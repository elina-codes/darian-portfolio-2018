                        <p>For people to selflessly help each other.</p>
                        <p>The goal was to make it fun and easy for friends and neighbors to give and get help for
                            anything, anywhere.</p>

                    <h3>The problem</h3>
                    <p>When I came on board, the devs had already built an MVP but were not seeing any traction at all.
                        There was no clear vision from the CEO, and every dev in the company had an equal say in how
                        the site should be designed and built. This resulted in a Frankensteinâ€™s monster of an MVP,
                        with no flow, no informational hierarchy or prioritization, and an overwhelming amount of
                        features that meant nothing to theirs users. </p>
                    <h3>My role</h3>
                    <p>I was hired on as the Lead UX Designer, to redo the MVP and to get this product back on track.</p>

                    <h3>Original designs</h3>
                    <p>This is what was built before I joined the company. It was designed and built by the
                        programmers, and seemed to have no consistency, focus, or flow. They knew it needed some work,
                        but did not understand how much, so I started doing quick Usability Tests to show them the
                        overwhelming, negative feedback, and that almost everything needed to change.</p>
                    <p><a href="#">Here are some raw notes from one of my quick usability tests.</a></p>
                    <p>Once I proved to the team and CEO that everyone I tested it with were running into some serious
                        issues, there was immediate buy-in for UX.</p>

                    <h3>Defining business goals</h3>
                    <p>After the shocking results from the usability tests, I worked with the CEO to define the
                        business goals. This presented an even greater challenge because he had not really defined them
                        before, and wanted to target two completely opposite audiences with the same features. </p>
                    <p>I worked with him and the team to come up with some targets to hit and some KPIs to start
                        tracking. Then I had them create a new roadmap and we agreed on a deadline for the MVP of the
                        new version of Otherly.</p>
                    <p>We were really starting to feel like a team here.</p>

                    <p>Since the goal of this project was to make it easier for people to selflessly help each other, I
                        took a step back from the designs to do more research on Altruism and to find out what
                        motivated people to selflessly help each other. </p>
                    <p>I shared these findings with my team and we brainstormed ideas on how we could use this
                        knowledge in our designs.</p>

                    <h3>User research interviews</h3>
                    <p>With my knowledge on altruism and motivations, I needed to lock down a preliminary target
                        audience for our MVP. This would help us justify design decisions and give us a face to
                        empathize with. </p>
                    <p>I conducted around 30 research interviews in order to determine if any patterns could be
                        established in their answers to use as traits in our user personas.</p>

                    <p>From our interviews, we found some patterns in certain apps and sites that our users used on a
                        daily basis. For our MVP, we knew we needed to get something out that would be easy to use for
                        our users, so we incorporated common conventions from those apps and sites, as well as other
                        apps I found in my comparative analysis.</p>

                    <p>At this point, we were comfortable with the vision and direction of the product, so I then began
                        wireframing the functionality for the mobile version.</p>
                    <p>This allowed us to really consider what functionality we absolutely needed, as there was more
                        limited space than on web. From that, we knew we could put additional features and
                        functionality in our web app later on. </p>

                    <p>We then ran tests on our mobile and web app wireframes and iterated over and over again until we
                        were getting consistently good feedback. Once I was satisfied that we were getting the goal
                        across with the functionality and information prioritization, it was time to pass these off to
                        the Interface Designer, so they could turn them into mockups with a proper style.</p>

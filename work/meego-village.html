                        <p>Made by <a href="http://athinkingape.com/" target="blank">A Thinking Ape</a>, Meego Village
                            was a builder game where you had to raise Meegos to build the biggest village possible.</p>

                    <h3>My role</h3>
                    <p>The game had been out for a few years already, and was seeing a decrease in engagement. I took
                        over as Product Lead and applied my UX skillset in an attempt to keep the revenue metrics
                        strong, and engage players once again.</p>

                    <h4>Big New Feature</h4>
                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <p>For new experimental and big features like Quest Portals, they can get very intricate and
                        interface-heavy, and we weren't sure how our target audience would respond to them.</p>
                    <p>The original designs for this feature, Quest Portals, involved cutting stones for a chance at
                        collecting a rare gem. Collect 5 different gems and you could open a portal to a new world with
                        exotic treasures and rewards.</p>

                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <p>I prototyped the entire feature to get early feedback from our target audience.</p>

                    <p>Here you can see the images I used in a paper prototype for the Stone Cutting feature alone,
                        which was just one part to the bigger feature. <a href="../images/meego-village-04.jpg" target="blank">Click
                            here to view the full image.</a></p>

                    <h3>Result</h3>
                    <p>Though our hardcore users found it fun, the main result from the majority of our test
                        participants was that it was too complicated and needed to be simplified. So we simplified it,
                        and it was still a success.</p>

                    <h3>More Design</h3>
                    <p>For other features that were not as in-depth, like Gifting, I would run quicker prototypes with
                        wireframes and mockups, as I still found them beneficial for the final version and it helped me
                        communicate those designs to the rest of the team.</p>

                    <p>Once I had the wireframes and prototype done, I would present it to the core team and reiterate
                        if needed. I would then write up a functionality document, outlining all of the edge cases,
                        which would then be shared with the team.</p>

                    <p>Here you can see an example of a wireframe I made and the final version in the game. On Meego, I
                        worked on dozens of different features to help increase our KPIs. If you want to see more
                        examples, please don't hesitate to reach out.</p>

                    <h3>Promotions</h3>
                    <p>When I first took over as Product Lead, it was essential for me to create events that coincided
                        with the user's journey, real world events, and holidays.</p>

                    <p>We made larger events for Halloween and Christmas, and smaller events for St. Patrick's Day,
                        Thanksgiving, and others. These events also required new features, like the gifting feature you
                        may have seen above.</p>

                    <p>All promotions were made after analyzing the metrics to determine where we needed that extra
                        nudge with our users to help boost our KPIs. Here you can see the Christmas load menu as well
                        as a wireframe for a special promotion targeted at our new users who seemed to be hitting a
                        wall in the first four levels of their journey.</p>

                    <p>The game remained alive for awhile and continued to generate revenue, but was eventually sunset.
                        Due to the technology we built it in, we couldn't feasibly continue adding more items into the
                        game without restructuring the game entirely. It was still one of the most addictive games I've
                        ever played though.</p>

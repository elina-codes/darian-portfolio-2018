                    <p>For this assignment, I had to choose between 3 scenarios given to me, and come up with a design
                        for the one I chose. Each scenario had details on the high level requirements, as well as some
                        given assumptions.</p>

                    <h4>Concert Reviews</h4>
                    <h3>What I Chose</h3>
                    <p>There are many different services which provide reviews of musicians and their album releases,
                        but none of these focus on evaluating the quality of a musician’s live performance
                        capabilities. There have been musicians whose albums we love, but we’ve walked away from their
                        live show quite disappointed.</p>
                    <p>Design an experience where concert-goers can submit positive comments and constructive
                        suggestions to the musicians and to share reviews with fellow fans of the musician who might be
                        considering attending a concert themselves. Consider how this UX experience might be different
                        for the musicians versus the public. Provide a high-level flow and supporting wire frames.</p>

                    <h3>Why I Chose Concert Reviews?</h3>
                    <p>The thing that appealed to me the most with this scenario was that I immediately identified with
                        this app, and I know several others who would benefit from this too. I have been to many music
                        festivals and I have seen some great bands put on horrible shows. Angus and Julia Stone are my
                        favourite example of this. I was looking forward to seeing them at Pemberton, but during their
                        performance, about half of the crowd left to go watch anything else at that time.</p>

                    <p>There were a few other things that appealed to me with this scenario for this design challenge.
                        One was that I could immediately see different types of users, and not just separating
                        musicians from fans. There could be fans that are hardcore concert attendees, that go once a
                        week to something, or fans that only go once every few months, and rely heavily on the reviews
                        of others. I couldn’t define them right away, but just knowing I could dive deeper into this
                        was exciting to me.</p>

                    <p>Finally, after doing a quick search on the internet webs, this idea was the most unique, as I
                        couldn’t find many other competitors out there. The others had quite a few, and after analysing
                        the other apps and making a list of some pros and cons, this one was still the one that
                        appealed to me most.</p>

                    <h5>Overview</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Identify the problem(s)</li>
                        <li>Create goals, strategy and success measurements</li>
                        <li>Generate a list of things we need to know about our users in order to solve this issue with
                            confidence.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>Time Spent</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Brainstormed with my team - 1 hour</li>
                        <li>Compiled and prioritized the results from the brainstorming session - 30 minutes</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>Details</h5>
                    <p>For the first step, I actually got 2 others together with me and ran them through the scenario
                        via Google Hangouts. These were people from my last company (the tech lead and the front end
                        lead).</p>
                    <p>I conducted a brainstorming session where we went over and refined the goals, and the UX
                        strategy (including measurements of success). The last half of the meeting was then to write
                        out anything we could think of that we would need to know about our target audience in order to
                        design this app with confidence.</p>

                    <h3>Refined Goals</h3>
                    <p>Normally I would work with the CEO or Product Manager to flesh out and refine the goals, but for
                        the sake of this assignment, we just made assumptions on their behalf. Here are the refined
                        goals we came up with:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To empower and encourage fans to publicly evaluate and review the quality of a musician’s
                            live performance.</li>
                        <li>To empower musicians with the knowledge of how the public feels about their performance so
                            they can make educated decisions for their future performances.</li>
                        <li>To release this with the highest chance of success right off the bat.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Day 1</h4>
                    <h3>Strategy</h3>
                    <p>Since we want this to be a success right off the bat, and there were no restrictions on time or
                        money to complete this, I decided this project would be best suited for a "Full UX" approach.
                        This means we need to collect sufficient user data early and at every step of the process
                        before we even begin developing it.</p>
                    <p>When it comes to the product strategy, there are a few base questions I like to ask which help
                        set up the hypotheses, success measurements, and how it all ties back to the goals. Here are
                        those questions and answers:</p>
                </div>
                <div class="grid__item work__image">
                    <p><strong>How do we define winning? For this to be successful, what would have to be true?</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It helps fans make educated decisions on what concerts to see</li>
                        <li>There are enough active users and reviews that the feedback is accurate and trustworthy.</li>
                        <li>Users can easily read and add reviews for the concerts they are trying to review.</li>
                        <li>Musicians use it to make educated performance decisions</li>
                        <li>Musicians can easily view their feedback</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>In what markets or niches do we want to be the market leader?</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The live music market</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Who will be our best users?</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The users that post the most legit reviews (not spam).</li>
                        <li>There was discussion about including the musicians in here as well, but this app is going
                            to need a lot of engaged users if musicians are going to actually listen to the feedback.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>How will we keep score and stay on track to win?</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We will track this through various quantitative methods, such as:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The number of legit users</li>
                            <li>The number of legit reviews.</li>
                            <li>Adoption and early engagement rates, such as downloads (organic vs non-organic),
                                logins, task completion, length of sessions...</li>
                            <li>Day 1/7/30 retention rates</li>
                            <li>Average revenue per user</li>
                            <li>Average revenue per paying user</li>
                            <li>Feature-specific metrics/telemetry indicators (to be defined as we flesh out the
                                product)</li>
                            <li>Partnerships and integrations with other apps/media, such as Google calendar to prompt
                                you to review the performance</li>
                            <li>Appstore ratings</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>We will also track this through qualitative methods, such as:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Qualitative feedback from our users through various channels</li>
                            <li>Appstore reviews</li>

                    <h4>Day 1</h4>
                    <h3>User Research Brainstorming</h3>
                    <p>From there, the team was on board with the problem, goals and strategy, so we then dove into the
                        information we would need to know about our target audience in order to design this with
                        confidence and to minimize the risk.</p>

                    <p>We realized right away that we are going to have a few different personas to design for. The
                        scenario alone mentioned two (the fans, and the musicians). But discussing it further, it was
                        obvious that there could easily be more. </p>

                    <p>We could have fans that go to concerts once a week, and love reviewing them on facebook, or on
                        their blog, or twitter. It might not matter to them as much if the concert wasn’t great. On the
                        other hand, we could have fans that go once every few months, and rely on the reviews of the
                        hardcore fans to make sure they are going to get a good show. They are less risky.</p>

                    <p>We could also have large, popular musicians, that only want a general idea on how their
                        performances and reviews compare to their stats from two years ago, or we could have small time
                        bands that live and breathe this app because they are just starting out and need more direction
                        and guidance.</p>

                    <p>Either way, in order to hone down who our target audience is, we compiled a list of questions
                        that we would need answered. From there, I grouped the questions to make it easier to digest or
                        ask participants, and Day 2 was all about collecting that information.</p>

                        with these mockups would be conducted and, once satisfied with the feedback, the devs would

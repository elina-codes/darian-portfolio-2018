            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              This started as
              <strong>a Unified University Clubs System</strong>
              that two friends and I were building in an attempt to learn some new skills and add something to our portfolios.
            </p>

            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>
              Being involved in several clubs in University,
              <strong>
                I discovered that club managers needed to have too many different ways to update their members on the club schedule and events.
              </strong>
              They needed, at the very least, a University website, a facebook page, and an email list.
            </p>

            <p>
              On top of having to update three areas for each change, the University page was hard to edit, not everyone wanted to use facebook, and emails, though effective for communication, were
              not able to host user generated content from previous events (they were boring!).
              <strong>
                I realized that a unified clubs system could solve all of this, and so the idea was created.
              </strong>
            </p>

            <p>Below are some selected examples of my work on the project.</p>

            <h3>The Clubs Page</h3>
            <p>
              After talking with several club members and managers, we came up with the requirements for this clubs system.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>
                I wish we knew the power of Lean UX back then, as we got a little carried away with designing additional features before it was even released.
              </strong>
              We designed ways to interact with clubs from other Universities, friend suggestions based on similar clubs you are in, and it just kept growing from there.
            </p>

            <p>
              Regardless,
              <strong>here you can see a snippet from the main clubs page.</strong>
              You can also

              , and

                the functionality document here

            <h3>Account Creation Page</h3>
            <p>
              Though we were only three working on this project,
              <strong>we still wanted to go through our ideal process at the time.</strong>
              I'm using the Account Creation Page for these examples.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>First you can see a very simple wireframe,</strong>
              which allowed us to get feedback on the kind of content we needed on screen.

              .
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Next I created a functionality document to pass on to the UI Designer</strong>
              so they had all the context for their mockups.

            <p>
              <strong>Next you can see the first draft of the mockups</strong>
              from the UI Designer.

              .
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>I then ran usability tests on the mockups</strong>
              via a low-fi prototype in order to get feedback as early as possible.

              <strong>Here are just a few more final designs for different areas of this project.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              This first one is of the Clubs News Feed. It was meant to mimic the style of a newspaper and surface personalized content from campus club updates.

              If I ever worked on this project again,
              <strong>I would trim this down to the core MVP.</strong>
              I would go back to the original idea for the project, which was the Clubs system, and really refine that. I still think there could be a need for this project, as I haven't seen anything
              out there that addresses these issues. Maybe one day!

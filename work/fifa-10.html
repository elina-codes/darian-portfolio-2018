                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>This was my first professional job in the industry. I was hired on by <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-ca"
                            target="blank">Electronic Arts</a> as a co-op student on the design team and was kept on
                        after I finished University.</p>
                    <p><strong>The main skills I learned</strong> on this project were how to <strong>rapidly iterate
                            on wireframes</strong>, and how to properly <strong>communicate my designs.</strong></p>

                            the Team Central feature.</strong></p>

                                design document</a></strong>, you can see the final mockup for the Team Central
                        feature, as well as <strong>the level of detail I went into in order to communicate those
                            designs</strong> to the rest of the team. The original document was 16 pages long but this
                        should give you a good idea.</p>

                    <p>I was never updated on what our KPIs were on these projects, so I don't really have a measurable

                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>Joining near the end of production, and right before release, my tasks were repetitive but,
                            coming from the Wii, a great intro into next gen development.</p>

                    <h3>My Role</h3>
                    <p><strong>I helped out on the design and production team</strong> by writing new stories for career mode, setting up tournaments, and answering questions from the translation team in Spain.</p>

                    <h3>Career Mode and Tournaments</h3>
                    <p><strong>One of my tasks was to write news stories for Career Mode</strong>, which were then translated into 16 different languages <strong>and made me the liaison with the Localization department in Spain.</strong></p>

                    <p>I was also tasked with setting up some tournaments, which required a lot of research on football
                        tournaments from around the world.</p>

                    <p><strong>Here you can see a screenshot from Career Mode</strong> where you can see my tiny, tiny bit of story at
                        the bottom-middle.</p>

                    <p>Though it was more filler tasks and not so much UX Design work, it was still a good experience.
                        It landed me a spot on FIFA Ultimate Team where I really got to start diving deeper into UX
                        Design for games.</p>

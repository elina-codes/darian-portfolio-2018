                    <h3>Their Old Product</h3>
                    <p>Their original platform was Sparq, which was developed over the last 15 years to meet specific
                        needs of specific companies for very specific tasks, and was never redesigned to include a
                        broader audience.</p>
                    <p>This led to a tool that was tailored to the needs of their existing customers, which was great
                        for retention, but poor for their adoption metrics.</p>

                    <h3>The Goal</h3>
                    <p>The goal was to create an updated version of the platform that kept the core functionality
                        intact for our current user base, and adapted it enough to make it more accessible and
                        welcoming for new users.</p>
                    <p>This new platform would be called Sparq Next Gen.</p>

                    <h3>How we worked</h3>
                    <p>On a team of about 7 UX Designers, each one of us worked on a separate area of the product, with
                        a separate product team and manager.</p>

                    <p>We would reconvene several times a week to update each other on our progress, and coordinate
                        cross-team features. We used a UI library to ensure our finished designs were consistent.</p>

                    <p>Oftentimes, we had to take extremely complex scenarios and break them down into new, more
                        intuitive interactions and flows, sometimes even cutting features and functionality along the
                        way.</p>

                    <h4>Example 1</h4>
                    <h3>The Condition Builder</h3>
                    <p>Essentially a complex filtering feature, the condition builder allowed our users to find the
                        perfect customers to target. It was extremely convoluted, as it was designed to the needs of
                        the few, highest paying users. I was in charge of adapting it to the needs of the majority of
                        our userbase.</p>

                    <p>I tackled the main use cases for it first, which I pulled from user data. I optimized the most
                        important ones, but also cut certain options for it, as they were barely being used, or would
                        take too long to build, and were only adding more confusion to the system.</p>

                    <p>Here you can see some screenshots of the original and final version of the condition builder, as
                        well as an <a href="https://invis.io/WV63QOVM2" target="blank">inVision Prototype</a> for some

                    <h4>Example 2</h4>
                    <h3>Profile Variables</h3>
                    <p>Anytime someone responds to a personal question in a survey sent out by Sparq Next Gen, each
                        response is collected and added to their profile. These bits of information are called Profile
                        Variables. They can be later used to, by the condition builder, to target specific people based
                        on their personal information.</p>

                    <p>In the original platform, users could only choose from a set list of Profile Variables to
                        collect information. My job was to add functionality to the existing version of this, such as
                        creating a new Profile Variable, editing/sorting/filtering them, removing them, adding empty
                        states in the UI and addressing all of the edge cases that came with these features.<p>

                            <p>After coming up with the requirements from analyzing the results of our user research
                                interviews, I tested all of my designs using prototypes built in sketch and inVision. I
                                also wrote up functionality documents for all major updates to this feature.</p>

                    <h3>The Main Dashboard</h3>
                    <p>On top of those larger tasks, I was also working on dozens of smaller ones. Resources were often
                        tight at Vision Critical, so I would sometimes redesign features in phases so we could get
                        something in front of our users sooner, without taking up too much dev time.</p>

                    <p>The Dashboard is a good example of that. It was an obnoxious, bare screen at first but I managed
                        to increase satisfaction on it with a few tweaks pushed out over several iterations.</p>

                    <p>Here you can see the first version of the dashboard that was launched right before I joined the
                        company. That screenshot was from everything above the fold on a 13" macbook. Next you can see
                        the proposed updated version. You can also see the <a href="../images/sparq-next-gen-99.jpg"

                    <h3>Close Date Scheduler</h3>
                    <p>I tackled these smaller tasks with proper documentation and prototype testing whenever possible
                        because, not only does it help communicate them to the dev team, it also helps solve creative
                        arguments.</p>

                    <p>This example is a small update that was required because we found our users were not using the
                        "Close Date" feature, however, there were too many opinions on how it should be addressed, if
                        at all.</p>

                    <p>I ran the <a href="https://invis.io/K861KLFC6" target="blank">inVision prototype</a> by some
                        users, and presented the feedback to the stakeholders. It was then approved for production and
                        I wrote up the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OU2zLEWUw4nAx3vsHJ_lX16xiptT2Z3lKn2o79DpaU0/edit?usp=sharing"

                        continuously being updated and reiterated with several other features at once. Release cycles
                        were also extremely long and there was not a lot of communication from the upper management
                        team who got to see the affected numbers. Either way, I learned a lot about working on a large
                        UX team and how to balance a lot of projects at once.</p>

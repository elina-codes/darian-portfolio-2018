                            Their original platform was
                            <strong>Sparq, which was developed over the last 15 years</strong>
                            to meet specific needs of specific companies for very specific tasks,
                            <strong>and was never redesigned</strong>
                            to include a broader audience.

                        <p>
                            This led to a tool that was tailored to the needs of their existing customers, which was
                            great for retention, but
                            <strong>poor for their adoption metrics.</strong>

                                On a team of about 7 UX Designers, each one of us worked on a separate area of the
                                product, with a separate product team and manager.
                            </strong>

                        <p>
                            We would reconvene several times a week to update each other on our progress, and coordinate
                            cross-team features. We used a UI library to ensure our finished designs were consistent.
                        </p>

                            <strong>
                                we had to take extremely complex scenarios and break them down into new, more intuitive
                                interactions and flows
                            </strong>
                            , sometimes even cutting features and functionality along the way.

                            . It was extremely convoluted, as it was designed to the needs of the few, highest paying

                            . This was understanding what functions and features were most used, and understanding the
                            implications of keeping some, and cutting others.

                            </strong>
                            , and also cut certain options for it, as they were barely being used, or would take too
                            long to build, and were only adding more confusion to the system.

                        <p>
                            Anytime someone responds to a personal question in a survey sent out by Sparq Next Gen, each
                            response is collected and added to their profile. These
                            <strong>
                                bits of customer information are called Profile Variables. They can be later used by the
                                condition builder to target specific people based on their personal information.
                            </strong>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In the original platform, users could only choose from a set list of Profile Variables to
                            collect information.
                            <strong>My job was to add functionality to the existing version of this</strong>
                            , such as creating a new Profile Variable, editing/sorting/filtering them, removing them,
                            adding empty states in the UI and addressing all of the edge cases that came with these
                            features.

                            <strong>
                                I came up with the requirements from analyzing the results of our user research
                                interviews. I tested all of my designs using prototypes built in sketch and inVision. I
                                also wrote up functionality documents for all major updates to this feature.

                            On top of those larger tasks, I was also working on dozens of smaller ones. Resources were
                            often tight at Vision Critical, so
                            <strong>
                                I would sometimes redesign features in phases so we could get something in front of our
                                users sooner
                            </strong>
                            , without taking up too much dev time.

                        <p>
                            The Dashboard is a good example of that. It was an obnoxious, bare screen at first, but I
                            managed to increase satisfaction on it with a few tweaks pushed out over several iterations.

                            This example is a small update that was required because

                            cycles were also extremely long and there was not a lot of communication from the upper
                            management team who got to see the affected numbers. Either way,

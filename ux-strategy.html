            <h2>What is a UX Strategy?</h2>
            <p>
              A UX Strategy is the tailored plan and approach for a site or product. This tailored plan consists of a carefully chosen collection of UX methods, put together in a specific order, and
              adjusted to fit user needs, technical constraints, and business goals. In short, it’s taking the UX methods listed on this site and putting them in order.
            </p>
            <p>
              Though that may sound easy, understanding which methods to include in a plan only comes after enough understanding of each method, resources, budgets, timelines, constraints, UX maturity
              at the company, and more. There is no one way to determine a UX Strategy, and each strategy may be different than the last, which is why it is a difficult method to pull off.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are a lot of variables in forming the right UX Strategy, and a well thought-out UX Strategy will help guide a team through the product life cycle, with confidence that they are
              solving the right problems for their users and the company, and in the right order.
            </p>

            <h2>How do you create a UX Strategy?</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <h3>Step 1: Understand the business goals</h3>
                Meet with your Product Manager or whoever has the deepest understanding of the goals, and clarify them. Look for any evidence that the goals were created based on either data or
                assumptions. If the goals were created on assumptions, you may need to propose extra methods into your strategy to validate those assumptions.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>You may want to ask questions like:</strong>
                <br />
                - What are the current goals?
                <br />
                - Which of these goals do we want to solve?
                <br />
                - Why are we prioritizing this goal over the others?
                <br />
                - How were the goals determined?
                <br />
                - What are the risks if we are wrong about the goals?
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Step 2: Understand the user needs</h3>
                You also need to understand if the user needs are based on data or assumptions, as this will change your proposed UX Strategy too. If user needs are based on assumptions, you may need
                to add extra UX methods into your strategy to validate those assumptions, or you may want to propose a Lean UX approach and validate them after.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Some questions you can ask are:</strong>
                <br />
                - How do we know these are user needs?
                <br />
                - What is the data that suggests this? Where can I find that data?
                <br />
                - Who determined these were user needs, and how?
                <br />
                - What are the risks if we are wrong about the user needs?
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Step 3: Understand the constraints</h3>
                Understanding your constraints like timeline, budget, resources, and technical limitations should help you refine the list of UX methods you add to your UX Strategy. If it’s a tight
                timeline, you may need to find the balance of UX methods that can be done quickly and that offer the biggest payoff. If your resources or budget is a constraint, you may need to focus
                on cheaper UX methods. Have a 30 minute meeting with the person that can help you understand these. That’s all you probably need.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Step 4: Assess your confidence and consequences of being wrong</h3>
                This is where the steps to creating a UX Strategy can get tricky and diverge. Your main goal at this point is to make sure you are focused on the right user problems and the right
                business goals, otherwise, any solutions you come up with afterwards have a higher risk of missing the mark.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>So you may have to ask yourself:</strong>
                <br />
                - Do we have enough confidence in our user needs and business goals?
                <br />
                - Are we comfortable we can proceed, with confidence, through the identified constraints?
                <br />
                What are the consequences if we are wrong?
                <br />
                <br />
                In general,
                <strong>if you are not very confident</strong>
                in the user needs and business goals,
                <strong>and the consequences of being wrong are high</strong>
                , then it is in your project’s best interest to apply some UX methods towards validating these user needs and business goals before you can figure out a proper solution. If that’s your
                case, jump to step 7, and create a strategy just for that. However, if you are confident in your user needs and business goals, you can continue to the next step.
                <br />
                <br />
                Another divergence would be
                <strong>if you are not confident</strong>
                in your needs and goals,
                <strong>and the consequences of being wrong are low</strong>
                . If that’s the case, you may wish to continue to the next step, and go for more of a Lean UX game plan that focuses on building something based on assumptions and validating it
                quickly after release.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Step 5: Brainstorm solutions</h3>
                Now it’s time to brainstorm solutions that can address those business goals and user needs, and also fit within your constraints. Now is a good time to get more people involved too.
                Work with your stakeholders, Product Manager, and team to brainstorm some solutions, and refine the ones that seem like the best fit.
                <br />
                <br />
                Do you have any data to support any of these ideas? If you don’t, consider adding some UX methods into your strategy to validate these possible solutions before deciding on any, or if
                the risks of being wrong are low, you may want to choose a solution and a more Lean UX approach and focus on validation after release.
                <br />
                <br />
                Some companies with a low UX Maturity level may come to the table with solutions already. That is fine, but you must do your due diligence to ensure that those solutions were generated
                based on data. If they were not, you need to understand the risks if those solutions are not the right ones.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Some questions you may want to ask are:</strong>
                <br />
                - How did you come up with these solutions?
                <br />
                - Where is the data that gave you these ideas?
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Step 6: Hypothesize</h3>
                Capture your solutions, user needs, and business goals in specific hypotheses.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>For example:</strong>
                <br />
                We believe that adding new, in-app dashboards based on the data from our popular reports (solution) will allow our users to spend less time digging through thousands of rows of
                spreadsheet data and more easily find what they are looking for (user needs) which will increase our in-app engagement and retention metrics (business goals).
                <br />
                <br />
                You should aim to have a separate hypothesis for each solution, but some hypotheses may encompass one or more business goals or user needs.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Step 7: Create your UX Strategy</h3>
                Now that you have your hypotheses, and you understand the risks of being wrong with any of your assumptions or solutions, you can finally (and confidently) choose which UX methods to
                include in your UX Strategy, and in what order.
                <br />
                <br />
                Factor in everything we have covered and select the UX methods that can feasibly be done within your timeline and that will reduce the most amount of risk going forward with your
                project. Put them in a list, along with the length of time it will take to complete each one.
                <br />
                <br />
                Remember, UX is all about empowering confident decisions in design. Some methods may be quick to do, but other, longer methods may lower your risk more and provide you and your
                stakeholders with more confidence.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Step 8: Review your UX Strategy and make adjustments</h3>
                Now that you have your proposed list and UX Strategy, review it with your stakeholders or Product Manager. You may have to make some trade-offs and adjustments, which is why you need a
                deep understanding of the pros and cons of each UX method you’re suggesting.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Step 9: Start work on your plan</h3>
                Once you have finalized your list, you can now start at the top and work your way down. Good luck!
